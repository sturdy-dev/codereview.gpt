## Usage

- Navigate to a GitHub Pull Request that you want a review for.
- Click the extension icon
- If you have not already, the extension will ask you to log in at [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
- You get code review comments from ChatGPT in the popup window

**NB:** Running the review multiple times often produces different feedback, so if you are dealing with a larger PR, it might be a good idea to do that to get the most out of it.

## FAQ


###

**Q:** Are the reviews 100% trustworthy?

**A:** Not yet, as of 2022. This tool can help you spot bugs, but as with anything, use your judgement. Sometimes it hallucinates things that sound plausible but are false ‚Äî¬†in this case, re-run the review.

###

**Q:** What aspects of the Pull Request are considered during the review?

**A:** The model gets the code changes and the commit messages in a [patch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch) format.

###

**Q:** Does the extension post comments on the Pull Request page?

**A:** No. If you want any of the feedback as PR comments, you can just copy paste the output.

###

**Q:** Is this a GPT wrapper?

**A:** Yes, [but](https://twitter.com/creatine_cycle/status/1600331160776998913)
